# Sentence mood-detection

This is a lesson practice and the sample code isã€€from Course of <a href="https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses.html">Professor Haungyi Lee in NTU</a>.
This work here is a process of understanding NLP model structure and Pytorch API through implementation practice.

We use LSTM model and word embedding to accomplish the training model.
Label 1 means the sentence contains positive mood (happy etc.  
Label 0 means the sentence contains negative mood ( sad, angry etc.)  

## Data description
There are three files in the dataset:
1. Training data with label:
